# Teenage Healthcare Data Analysis

This project analyzes a healthcare dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to uncover patterns specifically related to **teenage patients (ages 13â€“19)**. The dataset originally includes 55,500 records, from which 1,693 teenage entries were extracted and analyzed.

---

## Project Objectives

- Explore demographic trends among teenage patients (gender, blood type).
- Identify the most common medical conditions and medications.
- Analyze hospital admission patterns, billing, and length of stay.
- Investigate the relationship between blood type and medical condition using statistical analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Tableau (for interactive visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Insights

1. **Demographics**: Female teens slightly outnumber male teens in the dataset.
2. **Health Trends**: 
   - Arthritis is the most common condition overall.
   - Ibuprofen is the most prescribed drug for females; Lipitor for males.
3. **Cost & Billing**:
   - Hypertension has the highest mean billing amount, despite being less prevalent.
   - Negative billing values indicate copayments, and these were excluded from average cost analysis.
4. **Length of Stay**:
   - The average stay is 15 days; Obesity-related cases had slightly shorter durations.
5. **Admissions**:
   - Emergency admissions are most common across both genders.
   - September 2019 saw the highest number of admissions.
6. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - No statistically significant relationship was found between blood type and medical condition (p-value > 0.05).

## ðŸ“Š Tableau Dashboard

To complement the data analysis, an interactive dashboard was created using Tableau to visualize key healthcare insights among teenage patients.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells step by step to follow the data analysis process.

## Conclusion
-
This project reveals critical insights into the healthcare utilization patterns among teenagers. While conditions like arthritis and obesity are more prevalent, hypertension cases tend to be more costlyâ€”possibly due to more complex care needs or associated comorbidities. The absence of a statistical link between blood type and condition suggests that other factors play a more substantial role in teen health outcomes. These findings can guide further research, policy development, and educational efforts in adolescent healthcare.
